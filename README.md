# Shopping-Management-System
This is a console-based Shopping Management System built in C++, applying all core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows users to view products, place orders, and manage inventory.
Key OOP features used:
Classes & Objects to represent products, users, and orders
Encapsulation for secure data handling
Inheritance to extend functionality (e.g., Admin and Customer roles)
Polymorphism & Virtual Functions for flexible behavior
Operator Overloading for intuitive operations
File Handling to store and retrieve data
The project simulates a real-world shopping system and demonstrates strong understanding of OOP design and implementation in C++.
